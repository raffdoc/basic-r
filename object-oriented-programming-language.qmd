## Turing Machine Simple

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B(Read);
    B --> C{Is it 1?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Write 0, Move Right];
    C -- No --> E[Write 1, Move Right];
    D --> F(Halt);
    E --> F
    
```

## OO programming in R: classes and methods

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A["Classes: ideas of objects"] --> B["Objects"]
    B --> C["Methods: functions that belong to a class"]
    C --> D["Inheritance: classes can inherit from other classes"]
    D --> E["Polymorphism: methods can have different behavior depending on the class"]
    E --> F["Encapsulation: data and methods are bundled together"]
    F --> A
```

## List of OO programming languages
-   R
-   Python
-   Java
-   C++
-   C#
-   PHP
-   JavaScript
-   Ruby

##  R: Classes and methods
- In R all software entities are objects
- Each object belong to a class
- A class is a general scheme for objects:
from a general standpoint it represents an “idea”,
i.e. the general structure of a given object
- Objects are realizations or instances of a class.


## Example: Creating a simple class in R
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    Object[Name of Object] --> Container[What object contains realy]
```
